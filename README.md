# 🚀 LaunchMind — Multi-Agent Startup Builder

LaunchMind is an **Agentic AI system** that autonomously plans, builds, reviews, and improves a startup idea using coordinated AI agents.

The system demonstrates **multi-agent orchestration**, **LLM-based decision making**, **QA feedback loops**, and **automated GitHub workflow integration**.

## 💡 Startup Idea

FAST BookSwap is a campus-based marketplace that allows students to buy, sell, and trade used textbooks within their university.
Students verify using university email, list books using ISBN scanning, and coordinate safe on-campus meetups.
The goal is to reduce textbook costs and promote sustainable reuse of academic materials.

## 🧠 System Overview

LaunchMind simulates a startup team where specialized AI agents collaborate:

* 👨‍💼 **CEO Agent** — Task planning & decision making (LLM-powered)
* 📦 **Product Agent** — Product specification generation
* 🛠 **Engineer Agent** — Landing page creation & revisions + GitHub automation
* 📢 **Marketing Agent** — Marketing content + Email + Slack Block Kit message
* 🧪 **QA Agent** — Quality review & feedback loop
* 📨 **Message Bus** — Structured inter-agent communication
